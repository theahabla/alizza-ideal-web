## Is your website doing its job?

<div style={{float: "right", width: "30%",
	     minWidth: "128px", marginLeft: '1em',
	     padding: "0 var(--borderSpacing) 0 0"}}>
<GatsbyImage alt="Seles Person"

</div>

Many people have questions and concerns about their website that they have created.

- I created a cool website, but no one has contacted me.
- I've done the SEO as instructed, but it's not ranking high in the
  search results.
- What is the monthly maintenance fee being used for?

But what if you could make your website look like a hard-working
sales person?

## What is the website as a sales person working on the Internet?

If your website like a good sales person, you are able to
solve common website problems, and you can expect the
following effects:

* Stable inquiries from the website
* And the closing rate is awesome!
* Monthly maintenance work and costs are clear and small.
* You can let the website do the work of attracting customers,
  so you can spend more time on your customers and your
  personal life.
* So, your customers are satisfied, you and your family are
  satisfied, and you are fulfilled.

Such a website is an **official site** type website that
attracts customers without you having to attract them.  We are
committed to providing you with **results**.

> We are **committed to results**.
> We do not just create a website.

An official website is a place where customers can trust you,
have confidence in you Professionalism, authority, and track
record are the key to success.  We are the right choice for
**tax accountants** and **administrative scriveners**.

## The official website is what kind of website?

<div style={{float: "right", width: "30%",
	     minWidth: "128px", marginLeft: '1em',
	     padding: "0 var(--borderSpacing) 0 0"}}>
<GatsbyImage alt="Attract Customers"
	     image={props.images[1]} />
</div>

The official website we present here is not just a cool website created by a website production company.
It is different from just a cool website created by a website production company.

It is a website that can attract customers from the Internet, just like a salesman.

A website design company is a professional website designer.
They are not professionals in attracting customers or making sales.

If you are not building a website as a hobby, you should contact a professional website design company.
If you are not creating a website as a hobby, you should ask a professional to create a website that will attract customers and increase sales.

<clear/>

## What are your expectations for the website?

Many of us are working hard to advertise our services to
attract new customers now is the time to take advantage of the
opportunity. Many people are diligently promoting their
services in order to attract new customers.

However, they start a free social networking service or a
blog, but But, they are taking up a lot of time. But many
people are concerned that they will spend too much time on
social networking and blogging, which can be done for
free. Many people are feeling a sense of crisis.

So, if you build a cool website, you can expect visitors to
buy more and more services from you. If you build a cool
website, you can expect visitors to buy more and more services
from you.

## When you created your official website ...

But if you create an official website, it It will be easier to
attract customers and You will be able to concentrate on your
own business.

You will have more sales, more profit, and more time for your
personal life. more than you do now.

## Why does the official website do that?

Because we design your official website based on the state of
mind of people when they are buying something.

To put it simply, we design your website to

<div style={{float: "right", width: "60%",
	     minWidth: "256px",
	     margin: '1em 0 0 1em', padding: "0 var(--borderSpacing) 0 0"}}>
<GatsbyImage alt="Attract Customers"
	     image={props.images[4]} />
</div>

1. Attract, and
2. To generate interest in the product.
3. To generate trust and credibility, and
4. Make them feel secure
5. Make them purchase the product.

The order is as shown in the above steps.

<clear/>

Many websites do not show this order,
or only partially describes them.

The reason is that many website production companies set the
production cost as "how much it costs on an A4 sheet".  This
means that your budget will only allow you to make this
much. That's why.

However, the price of a website is the same as that of an
application.  The price should be determined based on the
functionality to achieve the objective.

If it doesn't achieve its purpose, it is not worth the fee, no
matter how cool it is.

## Why is the order important?

A typical website will suddenly go into a description of
services or display cool images of services.

However, let's compare our interaction with customers to a
group blind date.

When you first introduce yourself, Do not start with "please
go out with me" or "are you free after this?"

Nor do you explain your own specifications.

- How much money you make a year
- How much money you have in savings
- What kind of big company you work for
- What kind of a famous university you graduated from.
- How expensive a car you drive
- how many expensive brand name clothes and bags you own.
- I have such and such a friend
- I raised that guy....

<div style={{float: "right",
             width: "30%", minWidth: "128px",
	     margin: '1em 0 0 1em', padding: "0 var(--borderSpacing) 0 0"}}>
<GatsbyImage alt="Reject"
	     image={props.images[5]} />
</div>

It is what we call bragging and selling.

What if you casually open a website and from the very
beginning it describes how good the contents, functions, and
features of the service are? Unless you are very interested,
you will probably not continue reading.

The order of explanation is also important on a website. It is
important to consider how the customer is feeling at the
moment and not to oversell.

The order of explanation is also important on a website.  It
is important to think about how the customer is feeling right
now It is important not to sell to the customer.

<clear/>

## But the official site can't do this!

<div style={{float: "right", width: "30%",
	     minWidth: "128px", marginLeft: '1em',
	     padding: "0 var(--borderSpacing) 0 0"}}>
<GatsbyImage alt="Hypnosis"
	     image={props.images[3]}/>
</div>

But as Adlerian psychology says.
You cannot change a person's beliefs or behavior.
You cannot sell something to someone who does not want it.

The only people who would want to do that are scammers or some kind of business solicitations.

You cannot manipulate or brainwash people.

So, if you want to sell goods or services even if you have to deceive people
official website is not suitable for you.

<clear/>

## So why does the official website deliver results?

<div style={{float: "right", width: "30%",
     	     minWidth: "128px", marginLeft: "1em",
	     padding: "0 var(--borderSpacing) 0 0"}}>
<GatsbyImage alt="Funnel Filter"
	     image={props.images[2]} />
</div>

So why is the official website so easy to achieve results without controlling or brainwashing the customer?
Why is it so easy to produce results without controlling or brainwashing customers?

The reason is that the official website is designed to get out of the minds of many people who visit the official website. Vague anxiety, doubt, suspicion, and hesitation about the service product are removed from the minds of many people who visit the official website. doubts, and hesitations are removed step by step as they continue reading.

And finally, it will increase the desire for your service product.

If you feel that you don't need it, stop reading and leave. If they feel they don't need it, they will stop reading and leave.

In other words, the official website is like a funnel. The funnel is a filter that purifies the customer's willingness to buy.

But maybe you are thinking, "Well, that's only going to attract a few customers!

- That's only going to attract a few customers!
- You might be thinking, "That's only going to get me a few customers!

You might be thinking, "But, but....

But, but...

<clear/>

## The end of a company that created a common website

The most common websites in the world are designed to get more
people to buy, sign contracts, or inquire.

However, such websites...

According to a survey by Japan's Small and Medium Enterprise
Agency, only 1.9% of 721 companies receive new orders from
their websites.

If there are 100 websites, 98 of them are not attracting
customers.  98 of them are not attracting customers.

Of the 505 companies that responded that their websites were
effective, only 5.9% (about 14 companies) responded that their
websites were effective.

Of the 100 companies, about 95 regret having created a
website.

## Why is it better to talk to a small group of people than to talk to a large group of people?

The gates may be narrow, but once inside, you will find a
large crowd.

And even if the number of customers is small, if you have a perfect fit for your service
If you have a small number of customers who are a perfect match for your services...
They are ideal customers who do not complain, bargain, or complain about the results.
They are ideal customers who don't complain, bargain, or complain about the results.

You don't have to spend time dealing with complaints.

And when that happens, the ideal customer will be the catalyst for more and more new customers.
And the ideal customer is the one who is not complaining about the value or the result.

And your ideal customer will buy from you again and again.
purchase your services again and again.

In other words, the customer is happy and you are happy.

### Remember the party analogy from earlier?

You'd rather be the one who looks good to everyone than the one who looks
than the one who looks only at you.
than someone who looks good to everyone else.
