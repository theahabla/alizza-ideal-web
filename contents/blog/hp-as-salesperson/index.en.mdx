  We hear this kind of concern from many people.

    - I made a cool website, but no one is contacting me.
    - I spent a lot of money on SEO, but my website doesn't rank high in searches.
    - I pay a monthly maintenance fee, but I don't feel like they are maintaining it.

  But what if you could create a website like this...

## But what if you could create a website like this?

* Constant inquiries come in from the website.
* And, the closing rate is awesome!
* Almost no maintenance costs.
* You can leave the customer attraction to the website.
* Your private time will be fulfilled.

There is such a website that solves common website problems.

It is an **official site** type website that attracts customers to your company.

This type of website is especially suitable for those who provide
services where trust, reliability, and professionalism are important.
This is the perfect solution for people in the following fields

- **professionals**
- **Therapists**
- **Chiropractors**
- **Construction companies**

## What kind of website is an official website?

The official website we are going to introduce here is not just a cool
website, like a front page signboard created by a website production
company.  It is different from just a cool website like a billboard
made by a website production company.

It is like a salesperson, attracting customers from the Internet.

## What everyone expects from the website

Now that COVID-19 has subsided, there are more opportunities to get
out and about.
However, power restrictions and high prices for the summer remain
somewhat worrisome.

Now is our opportunity to attract new customers.  There are many
people who are putting their best foot forward in advertising their
services.

However, everyone is saying that they are spending too much time and
money on advertising and promotion.

They are not able to spend time on their core business, which leads to
profits.  They say that their profits are being squeezed by the cost
of creating, maintaining, and upkeep of their websites.

Of course, a cool website can attract customers' attention.

But I was there 20 years ago during the dot-com bubble.

People who just wanted to brag that they made a cool website.

Since you are wise enough to have been intrigued by this page, you
probably didn't build your homepage just to look good.

You probably made it with the hope that visitors to your website will
actually inquire or come to your office and, ultimately, make a
purchase or sign a contract.

## What happens when you create an official website?

Certainly, a website design company is a professional who designs cool
websites.  However, they are not professionals at making sales.

If you create an official website, you will be able to focus on your
business.

You will have more sales, more profit, and more time for your personal
life.

## Why does the official website do that?

Because we design your official website based on the state of mind of people when they are buying something.

To put it simply, we design your website to

1. attract, and
2. to generate interest in the product.
3. to generate trust and credibility, and
4. make them feel secure
5. Make them purchase the product.

The order is as shown in the above steps.

Many websites do not show this order,
or only partially describes them.

The reason is that many website production companies set the
production cost as "how much it costs on an A4 sheet".  This means
that your budget will only allow you to make this much. That's why.

However, the price of a website is the same as that of an application.
The price should be determined based on the functionality to achieve
the objective.

If it doesn't achieve its purpose, it is not worth the fee, no matter
how cool it is.

## Why is the order important?

A typical website will suddenly go into a description of services or
display cool images of services.

However, let's compare our interaction with customers to a group blind date.

When you first introduce yourself, you don't suddenly say, "Will you
marry me?  This is like asking someone to buy my products from the
beginning of a website.

Nor do you explain your own specifications.

You don't tell otherone how much money you make a year, or how much
money you have in savings, or what kind of big company you work for,
or what kind of a famous university you graduated
from.

Or how expensive a car you drive, or how many expensive brand name
clothes and bags you own.

Or I have such and such a friend,  or I raised that guy....

This is a common website that suddenly starts explaining what it does
and how good the features and functions are.

So-called bragging? In sales, it is a sales pitch.

If there is such a person, don't you think he or she is a cringy.

It is the same with homepages.  The order in which you tell your
customers is important.

Don't just talk about yourself or
make sales pitches without considering how the customer is feeling.

## But the official site can't do this!

As they say in Adlerian psychology.  You cannot change the way people
think or act.

You can't sell something to someone who doesn't want it.  The only
people who do that are scammers or solicitors for some kind of
business.

Therefore, it is not suitable for scammers or those who are in a
certain business.

The official website will filter through the many people who visit the
website.

Customers who are convinced that this might be right for me.  They
will read on to the next paragraph, and the next, and the next.

Only those who really want your service will remain until the end.  It
works like a funnel.

- Then I get only a few customers!  Well, I want everyone who sees my
- website to contact me!

You may think like the above.

But...did they get many customers with the conventional website?

## The end of a company that created a common website

The most common websites in the world are
designed to get more people to buy, sign contracts, or inquire.

However, such websites...

According to a survey by Japan's Small and Medium Enterprise Agency,
only 1.9% of 721 companies receive new orders from their websites.

If there are 100 websites, 98 of them are not attracting customers.
98 of them are not attracting customers.

Of the 505 companies that responded that their websites were
effective, only 5.9% (about 14 companies) responded that their
websites were effective.

Of the 100 companies, about 95 regret having created a website.

## Why is it better to talk to a small group of people than to talk to a large group of people?

The gates of heaven may be narrow, but once inside, you will find a
large crowd.

And even if the number of customers is small, if they are perfectly
suited to your business, they will be more likely to come to you.

You don't want to waste your time with complainers, do you?

If you can attract such ideal customers, they will be the catalyst to
attract more and more new customers.

And, ideal customers will purchase your services again and again.

In other words, a chain reaction of profit is created.

Let's go back to the first example of a group blind date.

You would rather have someone who is looking only at you than someone
who is looking at everyone else.

### What kind of official website can you create?

Now it is time to explain what exactly we will create.

The following pages will be created for the official website.

- Top page
  - Appeal to customers
  - Achievements and background
  - Differences from rivals
  - Reason why the customer signed the contract
  - Features of our services
  - Testimonials
  - Exclusive Campaign Information
  - Free Consultation Guide
- List of products and services
- Products & Services Details Page
- Testimonials page
- Self-introduction and company philosophy page
- Each page is available in multiple languages.

We will combine these parts and create the website in accordance with
the customer psychology we have just described.

Did you notice that there is no blog or "What's New" page?

These would be more effective if you were posted on Google Business
Profile.  You can then register your website URL on Google Business
Profile.

For this reason, we do not provide blogs or other information on our
official website.

If you have not yet registered your business on Google Business
Profile, I will do it for you.

## What is the price on the official website?

Thank you for reading this far.

If you have read this far, you are probably quite interested in our official website creation.

I am sure you are wondering how much it costs to create an official website.

I know someone who had a website created about two years ago.

At that time, she had fewer and fewer customers, and when she finally had no customers, a Tokyo-based website production company called her and asked her to create a website.

It cost about 300,000 yen at that time.

Furthermore, since the site did not show up in searches, she ordered SEO solutions for more than 100,000 yen, just as the production company had told her to do.

She regretted that it had no effect.

### How do you make an official website?

Before we talk about the price of an official website, we will explain
how we will produce it.  Please judge whether the price is really
worth it or not.

1. YOUR BUSINESS INFORMATION INTERVIEW
   - We will ask you about your business from the customer's point of
     view.
2. RECEIPT OF PHOTOS OF YOUR BUSINESS
   - We will ask you to provide us with a photo of your business.
     Photos taken with a smartphone are fine. If we do not have a
     suitable photo, we will come and take one.
3. TESTIMONIAL INTERVIEW
   - We can provide you with a questionnaire that will be effective
      in gaining the customer's trust.
   - If you have a reputation as a customer no matter what, we will
     use it.
4. RISK REVERSAL SETTING
   - When the customer is wondering whether to buy or not, we set up
      a risk reversal so that the customer feels that there is no loss
      even if they do not get the results they are looking for.
   - We will provide you with a few examples to choose from.
5. WEBSITE EXCLUSIVE CAMPAIGN
   - We will set up a campaign that offers a discount if customers
     purchase through your website.
   - We will provide you with a few examples to choose from.
6. Introduce yourself and your philosophy
   - We will ask you about your philosophy and self introduction.

We will conduct our meetings via Basically, we will use Google Chat (a
chat service like Chatworks) or Google Video (like Zoom).  Google
Video (a video conferencing service like Zoom).  Both services are
free of charge.

If you come to our office in person, we can also conduct face-to-face
meetings.

### Creation is not the end of the process

Our official website production service does not end when it is
created. Even if you create an official website, if no one sees it, it
is as if it never existed.

Moreover, we do not simply improve SEO.  SEO improvements often become
meaningless once Google's search engine is updated.

There was another update recently at the end of June 2022. At that
time, some of them saw a 57% decrease in sales in two days.

We will take preventative and maintenance actions to ensure that this
does not happen.

improve their website. I can also give you some advice.

But if you hire me, I will reduce your risk with this guarantee.

5. you no longer have to worry about whether or not customers will
   come this month
